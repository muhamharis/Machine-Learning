# Machine Learning

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is __to build/maintain a predictive model on each of the dataset and as a knowledge base to reflect on__

### Methods Used
* Descriptive Statistics
* Data Visualization
* Pre-processing
* Feature Selection
* Machine Learning
* Ensemble Methods
* etc.

### Technologies
* Python
* Scikit-Learn
* Numpy, Matplotlib, Pandas
* Jupyter Notebook
* etc. 

## Project Description
* Datasets used for this project mostly available on Kaggle or UCI Machine Learning Repository. 
* Descriptive statistics such as data summary, correlations, skewness used to understand data. 
* Data visualization such as histograms, density plots, boxplot, correlation and scatter plot matrix used to visualize data. 
* Used linear and non-linear algorithms to discover which algorithm perform well on the problem. 
* Improve algorithm performance with tuning parameters and ensemble methods.  

## Needs of this project

- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- machine learning modeling
- etc.
